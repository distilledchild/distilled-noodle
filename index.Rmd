# Hola!

Sorry. I cannot Spanish at all, but I wanted to make this webpage look lit with the quirky phrase, **Distilled Child**. This webpage was building using [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), and I was looking for a child attribute value when programming something, so I ended up mingle both. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the website. As of now (01/11/2023), Only here and contact pages are done.
